  Do you want to add exceptions to method signatures in the whole method hierarchy?





# {0} - original keyword (extends or implements), {1} - proposed keyword (implements or extends), {2} - class name

# {0} - original method signature including name, {1} - method name, {2} - proposed new parameters list

# {0} owner class name


# change if (!a == b) ...  =>  if (!(a == b)) ...


# Sample: Boolean b = "true"; -> Boolean b = Boolean.valueOf("true");

# {0} - qualified class name suggested to be imported.
  There are possible side effects found in expressions assigned to the variable ''{0}''<br>\
  You can:<ul><li><b>Remove</b> variable usages along with all expressions involved</li>\
  </body></html>
# {0} - variable name, {1} - variable type, {2} - expression with side effect, {3} - same expression transformed to hold the effect
  There are possible side effects found in expressions assigned to the variable ''{0}''<br>\
  You can:<ul><li><b>Remove</b> variable usages along with all expressions involved, or</li>\
  <li><b>Transform</b> expressions assigned to variable into the statements on their own.<br>\
  That is,<br>\
